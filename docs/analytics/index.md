# What is CoRA Analytics?
Add the CoRA Analytics blurb here.

Commingled human remains are often encountered in archaeological and forensic contexts. A bone by bone inventory is an important step in segregating commingled remains into individuals and determining the minimum number of individuals present. In order to achieve individual identification a controlled and consistent specimen-level inventory procedure must be followed. The **Commingled Remains Analytics (CoRA)** web application, database and APIs are a `community resource` for inventorying assemblages of commingled human remains, while `providing a framework of analytic methods, visualization techniques and tools` to assist in the segregation and identification process.
