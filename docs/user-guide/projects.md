## AAFS 70th Annual Presentations, Workshop \#7
Wecome to Workshop \#7: Data Standards, Archiving and Analytics in Forensic Anthropology

Program Description: Presentations of a unified data architecture and ontology for recording and managing biometric data in
forensic anthropology will be presented in this session.

Educational Objective(s): After attending this presentation, attendees will understand the benefits of a unified data architecture
and ontology of forensic anthropology data, which enables the development and implementation of software applications for data
analytics. Attendees of this session will join a community of users and will gain access to open source software for recording and
managing biometric data in forensic anthropology.

Impact on the Forensic Science Community: This presentation will impact the forensic science community by providing access to
an ecosystem of software applications for forensic anthropology that facilitates casework analyses. Casework efficiencies are realized
through a common ontology, enabling data sharing and opportunities for new methods. The ecosystem of applications is based on
open source software that fosters collaboration and community engagement via appropriate interfaces and Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs).
